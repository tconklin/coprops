Determining the Properties of Submillimeter Galaxies
====================================================

This is a (close to) fully functioning way to automate the reduction and analysis of sources observed with
a telescope. Included are 6 python files that range from statistical analysis to filtering observations. I 
wrote (that aren't proprietary) that go from reducing the observations to fully analyzing the physical properties
of the sources. Further work is done on creating FITS and NetCDFFiles directly after observations, however
none of the code is meaningful without dozens of other files in a separate, stand alone, reduction package.
